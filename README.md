# Demand of Bike Sharing system
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
As part of this case study we have to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
### Background of Bike sharing system and requirement:
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

### business probem that  project is trying to solve
This project will take the dataset provided by company of 2 years and try to identify the variables which can impact the future business,
On the basis of this data, this project will identify :
1- Right weather to open business
2- Shutdown period on the basis of weather, month
3- Day off for company
4- Maintainance time
5- Recommondation
- What is the dataset that is being used : 
Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors i.e. seasos, weather, weekday, weekend, everyday, temperature, humidity, wind

## Conclusions
# The comapany should focus on the following features:
# Company should focus on expanding business during Summer.
# Company should focus on expanding business during September.
# Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal,compared to 2019.
# There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes
# without having business impact or reshuffling the staff or other maintainance
# Hence when the situation comes back to normal, the company should come up with new offers during 
# Summer when the weather is pleasant and also advertise a little for September as this is when business would be at its best.
